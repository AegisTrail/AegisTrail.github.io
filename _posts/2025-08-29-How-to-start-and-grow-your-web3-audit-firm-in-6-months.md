You’ve decided to build something truly lasting in the Web3 space - A security firm. This isn’t just about finding bugs; it’s about building a company, a reputation, and a team. The first three months were about laying the foundation. The next three are about building on that foundation and turning a small operation into a professional, respected business.

This guide will take you through the first six months, with a strong focus on the details that really matter.

>This outlines my approach to launching a Web3 firm, and it does not mean that I already operate an audit firm.

## **Months 1-3: The Foundation**

This phase is all about setting up your business and getting your first client. It's the critical work that makes everything else possible.

### **Month 1: Legal, Branding, and Team Building**

This month is all about getting your hands dirty and building the core of your company.

- **Week 1: Laying the Groundwork**
![legal-yes](https://i.imgflip.com/a4iekm.jpg){: width="272" height="289" .w-30 .right}
    
    - **Legal Entity:** Get an **LLC** (Limited Liability Company). This isn't just a formality; it’s your shield. Without it, if a client sues, they could come after your personal assets, like your house or savings. A lawyer helps you navigate this so you can focus on the business, not legal risks.
    
        
    - **Branding:** Pick a name that sounds professional and trustworthy. Secure the domain name and social media handles. A simple logo and a basic one-page website with a clear "About Us" and "Contact" section are enough to get started.
        
- **Week 2: Sourcing Top Talent**
    
    - **Where the Best Auditors Are:** The top Web3 auditors often hang out on platforms like [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard), [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/leaderboard) and [Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/leaderboards). These sites host bug-finding contests, and their leaderboards are public. This is your talent pool.
        
    - **What it takes:** Dedicate a few hours each day to tracking leaderboards and reading past audit reports. Analyze what makes the top performers good. It's not just about technical skill; it's about their thoroughness and ability to explain complex vulnerabilities clearly.
        
- **Week 3: Outreach & Vetting**
    
    - **Personalized Outreach:** Never send a generic "we're hiring" email. Your message should be personalized and show you've looked at their work. Mention a specific bug they found or a report they wrote. This makes you stand out.
        
    - **Test their skills:** Before you bring anyone on board, give them a small technical challenge or a test audit.

    - **What if you do it:** You'll see their skills in action and know for sure they can do the job. You'll avoid hiring someone who just talks a good game but can't deliver.

    - **What if you don't:** ***You risk hiring someone who isn't skilled enough***, which could lead to a bad audit report and ruin your company’s reputation.
     

- **Week 4: Business Documentation**
    
    - **Client Contracts:** Your service agreement is the single most important document. It defines the scope of work, payment terms, and liability. A great contract protects you from "scope creep" when a client keeps asking for more work without paying for it.
        
    - **Internal Agreements:** Draft a partnership agreement outlining equity, responsibilities, and how your team will operate. This prevents future conflicts by setting clear expectations from day one.
        

### **Month 2: Marketing and First Client**

With your team ready, it's time to find your first client.

- **Week 5: Content Strategy**
    
    - **Become a Thought Leader:** Start a blog (Yes, like this one). Write posts that share your expertise. For example, do a **"vulnerability post-mortem"** on a recent hack, explaining in simple terms what happened and how it could have been prevented.
        
    - **What it takes:** Good technical writing takes time. You need to simplify complex ideas without losing accuracy. Start by writing one high-quality article per week.
        
- **Week 6: Targeted Outreach**
    ![moneeeyyy](/assets/posts/1/gold-digger.jpg){: width="290" height="29" .w-30 .right}

    - **Lead Generation:** Don't just spam people. ***Research projects that have recently raised money*** or are about to launch. Look at their code on GitHub. Are they active? Do they have a lot of contributors? These are signs of a healthy project that needs a professional audit.
        
    - **What it takes:** A few hours of research a day. You're not just looking for a client; you're looking for a good partner.
        
- **Week 7: The Pitch**
    
    - **The Case Study:** Your first pitch is the hardest because you don't have a portfolio. Instead, you'll rely on your team's individual reputations. In your pitch deck, highlight the specific bug-finding successes of your team members.
        
    - **Be Flexible:** For this first client, be willing to offer a discount. Your real goal is a success story and a testimonial.
        
- **Week 8: The First Project**
    
    - **Communication is Key:** Keep the client in the loop. Provide weekly updates on your progress. Don't go silent for two weeks and then suddenly deliver a report.
        
    - **Deliverable:** The final report isn't just a list of bugs. It’s a professional document that includes a summary for non-technical readers, a list of all findings (even minor ones), clear steps to fix each bug, and a recommendation on security best practices.
        

### **Month 3: Portfolio Building and Growth**

Your first successful project is the foundation for your firm’s reputation.

- **Week 9: Public Disclosure**
    
    - **Tell the Story:** With the client's permission, write a public report on the vulnerabilities you found. This isn't just a marketing tool; it's a way of giving back to the community and showing your commitment to Web3 security.
        
    - **What if you do it?** This report becomes your first major case study. It proves you can deliver and builds trust with future clients.
        
    - **What if you don't?** Your success remains a secret, and it's much harder to attract new clients.
        
- **Week 10: Scaling Operations**
    
    - **Standardize Your Process:** Document every step of your audit process. This makes it more efficient and ensures consistency regardless of which team members are working on a project.
        
    - **Auditor Pipeline:** Keep scouting and vetting new talent. Build a network of auditors you can call on as your firm grows.
        
- **Week 11: Sales and Client Acquisition**
    
    - **Leverage Your Credibility:** Now you have a case study. Your pitch is no longer about what you _can_ do, but what you _have_ done.
        
    - **Ask for a Testimonial:** Ask your first client for a quote about their positive experience. A good testimonial is social proof that is more powerful than any marketing you could create yourself.
        
- **Week 12: Review and Plan**
    
    - **Review and Analyze:** What worked? What didn't? What was the hardest part? Get feedback from both your team and your client.
        
    - **Future Planning:** Based on your revenue, determine when you can transition your top performers from a pay-per-project model to a stable salary. Set new goals for the next three months.
        

## **Months 4-6: Scaling and Specializing**

The second three months are about moving from "startup" to a truly established business.

### **Month 4: Expansion and Professionalism**

- **Week 13: Refine Your Website**
    
    - **Expand Your Site:** Your simple one-page site is no longer enough. Create dedicated pages for "Services," "Case Studies" (using that first successful audit), and "Our Team."
        
    - **What it takes:** A few days of dedicated work or a small budget to hire a freelance web designer.
        
- **Week 14: Diversify Your Offerings**
    
    - **Expand Your Services:** Your first service was a smart contract audit. Now, consider adding other services like **ongoing monitoring**, **incident response**, or **tokenomics reviews**.
        
    - **What it takes:** You and your team need to dedicate time to learning and specializing in these new areas.
        
- **Week 15: Formalize Your Business Processes**
    
    - **Get an Accountant:** Handling finances yourself becomes a headache as you grow. A good accountant can help you with taxes and financial planning.
        ![onboarding](https://c.tenor.com/4zhczlxeoucAAAAC/tenor.gif){: width="260" height="29" .w-30 .right}

    - **Automate:** Use tools for project management (like Notion or Asana), client communication (like Slack or Discord), and payment processing (like Stripe). Most Web3 firms pay in crypto, so ensure your hardware wallet with multi-sig security is set up properly.
    
    
- **Week 16: Deepen Your Industry Presence**
    
    - **Speak at Conferences:** Start applying to speak at major Web3 conferences or events. This is one of the best ways to build your firm's reputation and authority.
        
    - **What it takes:** You need a compelling topic and a well-prepared presentation. Speaking publicly shows that you and your firm are a leading voice in the industry.
        

### **Month 5: Scaling the Team and Operations**

- **Week 17: Build a Recruiting Funnel**
    
    - **Systematize Scouting:** Instead of just randomly looking for talent, create a formal system. Keep a list of promising auditors and a record of their past work. Reach out to them regularly.
        
    - **What it takes:** Consistent effort to build a network, not just a list.
        
- **Week 18: Onboarding Process**

    - **Create an Onboarding Guide:** When you bring on a new auditor, give them a clear guide on how your firm works, your standards for reports, and your communication tools. This ensures everyone is on the same page.
        
    - **What if you do it?** New team members can start contributing faster and with less confusion.
        
    - **What if you don't?** You'll spend valuable time answering the same questions over and over.
        
- **Week 19: Second Client**
    
    - **Use Your Case Study:** Your second client will be much easier to find. Use your first case study and testimonial in every pitch.
        
    - **Be More Selective:** You don’t have to be as flexible with your price this time. You’ve proven your value.
        
- **Week 20: Secure the Second Project**
    
    - **Repeat the Process:** Follow the same steps as with your first client, but be even more efficient. Use the documented processes you created earlier.
        
    - **What it takes:** A disciplined approach to project management and communication.
        

### **Month 6: The Future**

This is the month you truly become an established business.

- **Week 21: Expanding Your Network**
    
    - **Launch a Newsletter:** Turn your blog into a newsletter. This gives you a direct way to market to people who are interested in your expertise.
        
    - **Formal Partnerships:** Now that you have a track record, you can build more formal partnerships with Web3 VCs and incubators.
        
- **Week 22: Financial Review**
    
    - **Analyze Your Numbers:** With two clients under your belt, you have real data. Are you profitable? Where are you spending money?
        
    - **Plan for Salaries:** Based on your profits, ***make a plan to transition your best performers to a fixed salary.*** This will help you retain top talent.
